# Team Contract

Working together as a team is critical for your success on this project. Conflicts happen. It's best to develop a plan before conflict arises. This way your team knows exactly the ground rules for dealing with that conflict. You'll be developing a team contract that you'll follow throughout the duration of your project. The team contract is a *living* document. If it's not working, your team should revise it as often as necessary.

You will need to learn to work in groups and resolve conflicts on your own. These skills will be expected of you by your employer after graduation. Use this project as an opportunity to develop these skills. Lastly, you might want to take note of the issues you encounter and how you solved them. I'm almost certain that you will be asked during an interview about a time you had and conflict and what you did to resolve it.

## Contract

**Your group contract/working agreement should probably include these elements. Feel free to add other terms, too.**

1. To what goals do we all commit?
  1. Meet each project requirement to the best of our ability.
  2. Respect each other's needs
  3. Communicate effectively, clearly, and often.


2. What are our “ground rules”? (Don't make an exhaustive list—stick with just a few.)
  1. Let group members know if individual responsibilities cannot be met at least 24hrs before respective deadline.
  2. Always text in the group chat when first pulling and then pushing.
  3. Be honest when committing to a task and accountable for following through unless otherwise stating you cannot.


3. By what means and how frequently will we meet or communicate?
We will communicate by text daily on meeting times, objective completion and to ask questions.
We will use a google document to track objective and milestone progress. Also used for claiming/assigning specific tasks, managing tasks, setting deadlines for them.
At a minimum, meet Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday nights as a group of all four. Then, if needed, meet additionally with other members.


4. How will we communicate and work with our client?
We will communicate with our client via text. Jake will be the primary client liaison from meeting 1 to meeting 2.
Client meetings are tentatively scheduled for Monday evenings. We will use text or email to schedule meetings, and use face to face interactions to understand our client's needs, receive their feedback, and other more salient, important, complicated communications.


5. What roles will we create? Include a description of exactly what each role is responsible for.
Client Liaison
    - works with the client, sets up meetings, requests info when necessary, responds to emails
Task Organizer/Delegator
    - consolidates project description and milestone descriptions into tangible tasks, then delegates them among team members and sets deadlines for each task
Task Reminder
    - communicates tasks and deadlines to members, ensures each member is working diligently to the deadlines, reminds them of personal task deadlines
HR / "Vibe Checker"
    - stays on track of each member's commitment, ensures everyone is working on their individual tasks and creating a productive, collaborative team culture!


6. How will we hold ourselves and one another accountable? What (exactly) will we say to a team member who appears not to be contributing equally? To a team member who fails to deliver what was promised?
To hold ourselves accountable we will break down the tasks, itemize each other, and then assign each to a member. What we will say to the member who isn't contributing, sit down with them and tell them that from our perspective it seems as if they are slacking, and understand why they are acting this way, if there are extenuating circumstances. If it is not a special case, then give suggestions as for how this teammate can improve, or assign them tasks they feel more excited to do. If the behavior persists, then write it up in the team evaluation.

To a team member who fails to deliver: "Hey, it looks like you were not able to meet the expectations we all set for ourselves. Are there any extenuating circumstances? Please communicate farther in advance in the future, and  we would welcome you taking up extra work to make up for the work you did not complete."

7. What do we do when we disagree? What approach to conflict to we all agree to uphold?
Disagreements will be resolved in a all-hands meeting between the four of us by referencing the contract and task list, determining who is responsible for what and assessing available solutions to the problem.

8. What are our procedures for re-visiting this contract?
We will revisit and consider updates once weekly, minimum at our Monday night meetings, and when needed throughout the weeks.


9. What else do we want to include in this contract? (Think about a *fun* clause... not everything is always about work! Sometimes you need to celebrate your accomplishments!)

Weekly vibe checks to ensure everyone is totally feeling wavy, yo :).



## Using your Contract

You are expected to follow your team contract. If you are having issues (e.g. conflicts) in your team, the first thing you should do is follow the contract. If the contract isn't working, then your team should revise it.

If you cannot resolve your issue using the contract, you may reach out to the instructor via the <info1300-prof@cornell.edu> email. Be advised, that the first thing the instructor will ask you is, "did you try to resolve your issue with the contract?" The next question the instructor will ask you is, "what change did you make to your contract to resolve the issue?"
